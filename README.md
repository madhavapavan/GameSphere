## **Installation**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher).
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Create a PostgreSQL database named `players_website`.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/madhavapavan/GameSphere.git
cd players-website
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Set Up the Database**
1. Run the SQL script located in `database/init.sql` to create the necessary tables:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_db_user -d players_website -f database/init.sql
   ```
2. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:
   ```
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=players_website
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

### **5. Run the Application**
Start the server using:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
